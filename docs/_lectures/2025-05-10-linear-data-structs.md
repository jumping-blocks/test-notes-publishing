# Linear Data Structures

This section is about linear data structures. 

## Array 

An array is a contiguous chunk of memory. 

## Linked List 

A ***Linked List*** allows us to store data in a list, but in non-consecutive memory, which utilizes memory more effectively. 

```python

class LinkListNode():

	def __init__(self):
		self.payload = None
		self.next = None
		self.prev = None

```

## Stack

An ***Abstract Data Structure*** that exhibits a Last-In, First-Out behavior. 

## Queue

An ***Abstract Data Structure*** that exhibits a First-In, First-Out behavior.
